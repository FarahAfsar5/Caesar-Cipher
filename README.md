# Task-02: Caesar Cipher (Text Encryption & Decryption)

## 📌 Objective
To implement a **Caesar Cipher** encryption and decryption system in Python. This is a classical cryptography technique where each letter is shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Encrypts plaintext using a shift value.
- Decrypts ciphertext back to original using the same shift.
- Preserves case (uppercase/lowercase letters).
- Leaves non-alphabetic characters (numbers, spaces, punctuation) unchanged.

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Python (basic string manipulation)

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Run the script in Google Colab or any Python IDE.
2. Enter a message when prompted.
3. Enter a shift value (e.g., 3).
4. The program will display both the **encrypted** and
